The game was developed using Unity 5.5.2. We didn't use any other tools, libraries, etc, aside from GitHub for version control. 

All source code and project files are incldued in this folder. 

An Android Apk file can be found in the Builds folder, as well as a WebGL version (though the game is designed to be played on a mobile phone).
